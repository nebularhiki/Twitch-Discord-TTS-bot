# Aia TTS Bot

This is a basic TTS bot using Amazon's Polly TTS service

Make a .env file formatted like so and place it in the same folder as "main.py"

```.env
BOT_TOKEN = {token}
AWS_TOKEN = {token}
AWS_PRIVATE_TOKEN = {token}
```

Add your filter file to the filter folder formatted like "example.py"

I need to find a better way of doing this as having a file filled with not good words sucks and is not all that good.

To launch the bot make a shortcut to the batch file and launch it through that
